            Meet Joe and Alex, owners of Happy Java. <br /><br />
            Joe and Alex are a husband and wife team with many years combined experience in the hospitality industry.
            <br /><br />When an empty retail unit became available in the trendy market town of Lockwell, they jumped at the opportunity to set up Happy Java. That was 3 years ago.  They have invested one hundred percent of their time, savings and energy to ensure it's success.  <br/> <br/>They are proud to have the opportunity to share their dream with others and have made Happy Java hugely popular, with regular visitors enjoying their hospitality and delicious coffees and food.<br /><br />
            Why don't you drop by? They would love to meet you!!
